## Yay!

Finally, I can finish the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by Coursera. There are so many reviews about this course out there but I still want to give you some words.

> If you want to dive into Deep Learning as a beginner, you definitely should start with this course. However, it would not enough for you to really doing something serious as I found it more theoretical than practical. The good thing is, you will probably have a very good foundation to keep moving with other courses.

## Statistics

I used [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to track evey minutes of learning. At the end, it took me about 46 hours to finish all these 5 courses with an average grade of 98.08%. I started slowly at first, and worked really hard at the end.

## What DiD I Learn?

- You really don't need a solid mathematics background to learn and do Deep Learning.

> If you don't understand, don't worry about it.

- You actually can do some hacks on quizzes and coding assignments. First, because you can do them as many times as you want, you can easily achieve perfect grades for all the courses. Second, since the teaching team already explains well and gives you very clear instructions for each step of these assignments, I find sometimes I can still make it even when I don't really understand how tensorflow works underneath. 

## Useful Resources

- Summary notes by Tess Ferrandez: [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/notes-from-coursera-deep-learning-courses-by-andrew-ng). I've printed the notes and been using them to revise along and after the course.

## How Do I Feel Now?

## What's Next?

Courses:
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3](https://course.fast.ai/): This course may take more than 46 hours and efforts but it will give me a lot of chance to build some real Deep Learning models.

> If you want to become a Deep Learning expert, you need to train a lot of models. - [Jeremy Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6XcP4JOHmk&list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4)
