## Statistics

I used [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to track evey minutes of learning. At the end, It took me around 46 hours to finish all these 5 courses.

## What DiD I Learn?

- You really don't need a solid mathematics background to learn and do deep learning.

> If you don't understand, don't worry about it.
